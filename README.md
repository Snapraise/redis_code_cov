# RedisCodeCov

Would you like to know how much of your Rails app code in production is actually getting used?  And how often?  When we run our tests we can use code coverage metrics (like https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to see which parts of our code are not tested.  

This can be a great tool to see which parts of your code are used often and perhaps need to be improved for performance or test coverage.  Also, you can see which parts of your code are not exercised and perhaps those features can be removed.  

Warning - this is ALPHA quality software, be careful before running it in production.  It will increment a Redis counter for EACH method call.  Depeneding on your traffic it could slow down your application.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redis_code_cov'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redis_code_cov

## Usage

Create config/initializers/redis_code_cov.rb:
```ruby
redis_conn = Redis.new(host: 'localhost', port: 6379, db: 0)
REDIS_CODE_COV =  Redis::Namespace.new('codecov', redis: redis_conn)
```

In your ApplicationController (or another controller) add
```ruby
include RedisCodeCov::Controller
```
